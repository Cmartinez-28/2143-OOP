### Description: 

This assignment serves as a homework and study guide for the first test. It covers multiple OOP concepts, with questions for each
one and includes a code assignment to create a class that feels like it is a built-in type. The code must have private members,
three constructors, initialization lists, overloaded operators, and const correctness.
